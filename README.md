When I was a kid, you could pack an entire video game in 48kb. It goes without saying that technology has advanced a lot; the games of the 80s can't be technically compared to those we have today. And yet, it feels programming has become sloppy. The more resources we have, the less the creativity and the greater our laziness. It all leads to resource hogs that take too much space and are often buggy. And so, I gave myself what I termed the 48k challenge. I decided to make a retro-style video game in JavaScript, that had to be 48kb or less.
